üëãHiÔºÅI'm XianYu or you can call me my English name Moni !<br>
I'm learning Mechanics in ZheJiang Univesity. Now I'm  working on [Data-driven automated discovery of variational laws hidden in physical systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509619306246)  which explores the combination between Data Science and Physics<br>
I' m intrested in Cypepunk (NOT THE GAME! I HAVEN'T TRIED IT!). So I like the movies [" Ghost In The Shell "](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113568/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3_tt_8_nm_0_q_Ghost%2520in%2520the%2520) and [" Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence "](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0347246/?ref_=tt_sims_tt_i_2), both of them were directed by Mamoru Oshii. I also like the animated film series " Ghost in the Shell" directed by Kenji Kamiyama <br>
Now I'm learing C++ and Python<br>
