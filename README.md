一个潦草的记录者。喜好在生活逼仄的角落蹉跎着自己的人生，游荡在无止境的荒野，用贫瘠的文字记录着世间的悲喜，小心翼翼地整饬自己逐渐狭小的理想花园。当下正在一场不愿醒来的梦里似睡非睡，游离于低落的浪潮之间。不吝于向旁人给予自己的温暖，
但多数时候只是一个冷眼旁观者。渴望成为一个温柔的人，努力做一个谦逊的学习者。<br>
<br>
你可以叫我先於亦或莫聂，这些都是行走于当下这片土壤上的影子。<br>
<br>
总之，欢迎你来到这片属于我的世界

👋Hi！I'm XianYu or you can call me my English name Moni !<br>
I'm learning Mechanics in ZheJiang Univesity. Now I'm  working on [Data-driven automated discovery of variational laws hidden in physical systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509619306246)  which explores the combination between Data Science and Physics<br>
I' m intrested in Cypepunk (NOT THE GAME! I HAVEN'T TRIED IT!). So I like the movies [" Ghost In The Shell"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113568/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3_tt_8_nm_0_q_Ghost%2520in%2520the%2520) and [" Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0347246/?ref_=tt_sims_tt_i_2), both of them were directed by Mamoru Oshii. I also like the animated film series " Ghost in the Shell" directed by Kenji Kamiyama <br>
Now I'm learing C++ and Python, and I prefer the Former<br>
Anyway Welcome to my Garden of Eden! 🎉🎉🎉
